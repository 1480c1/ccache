Changes since ccache 2.4
------------------------

New features and improvements:

  - Object files are now by default stored compressed in the cache. The runtime
    cost is negligible, and more files will fit in the ccache directory and in
    the disk cache. CCACHE_NOCOMPRESS can be set to disable object file
    compression.

  - Added CCACHE_NOHASH_SIZE_MTIME option that tells ccache not to hash the
    real compiler's size and modification time.

  - Added CCACHE_HASH_COMPILER option that tells ccache to hash binary of the
    compiler instead of hashing just its size and modification time.

  - Temporary files are now created in the directory they will end up in. This
    makes ccache more friendly to Linux's directory layout.

  - Added support for long command-line options.

  - A CACHEDIR.TAG file is now created in the cache directory. See
    <http://www.brynosaurus.com/cachedir/>.

Bug fixes:

  - Fixed build on FreeBSD.

  - Improved detection of home directory.

  - User-defined CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS is now respected in the Makefile.

  - Bail out on profiling flags --coverage, -fprofile-arcs and -ftest-coverage.

  - Fixed NFS issues.

  - -MD/-MMD flags without -MT/-MF are now handled correctly.

  - Corrected LRU cleanup handling of object files.

  - utimes() is now used instead of utime() when available.

  - Non-writable cache directories are now handled gracefully.

  - Corrected documentation about sharing the cache directory.

  - Fixed compilation warnings from GCC 4.3.
