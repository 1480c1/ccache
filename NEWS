Changes since ccache 2.4
------------------------

New features and improvements:

  - Added CCACHE_NOHASH_SIZE_MTIME option that tells ccache not to hash the
    real compiler's size and modification time.

  - Added CCACHE_HASH_COMPILER option that tells ccache to hash binary of the
    compiler instead of hashing just its size and modification time.

  - Temporary files are now created in the directory they will end up in. This
    makes ccache more friendly to Linux's directory layout.

Bug fixes:

  - Fixed build on FreeBSD.

  - Improved detection of home directory.

  - User-defined CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS is now respected in the Makefile.
