<!--
  Thanks for contributing to ccache! Here are some hints to make the process
  smoother:

  * Is your pull request "work in progress", i.e. you don't think that it's
    ready for merging yet but you want early comments? Then create a draft pull
    request as described on
    <https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/>.

  * If you have Uncrustify <http://uncrustify.sourceforge.net> installed, you
    can run "make uncrustify" to adapt your modifications to ccache's code
    style.
-->

### Description ###
