CCACHE
======

ABOUT
-----

ccache is a compiler cache. It speeds up recompilation of C/C++ code by caching
previous compiles and detecting when the same compile is being done again. The
main focus is to handle the GNU C/C++ compiler (GCC), but it may also work with
compilers that mimic GCC good enough.

Please see the manual page and documentation at http://ccache.samba.org for
more information.
